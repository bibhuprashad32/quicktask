# Quicktask

A clean, local-first task management app built with React. I built this to handle state management, filtering, and local storage while keeping the UI responsive and modern.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Smart Filtering & Sorting:** Filter by active, completed, or overdue. Sort by creation date, due date, or priority.
- **Local Persistence:** Everything saves automatically to your browser's `localStorage`.
- **Data Portability:** Export your tasks as a JSON file and import them back anytime.
- **Dark Mode:** Full dark mode support using Tailwind CSS.
- **Smooth UI:** Fluid animations for adding and deleting tasks.

## Tech Stack

- React (Create React App)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling & Dark Mode)

## How to Run Locally

To get this running on your own machine, make sure you have Node.js installed, then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder: ``` cd quicktask ```
3. Install the dependencies: ```npm install```
4. Start the development server: ```npm start```

The app will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
